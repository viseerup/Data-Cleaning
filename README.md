# Data-Cleaning

This project shows the process of data cleaning. We get a database of human faces and we pretend to identify the pupil area. For the data we use techniques of thresholding and Morphology(opening or closing) and we apply a classifier to get the countours. After that from the face dataset we generate a pupils countours dataset and apply to it a quadratic least squares models as well as Ransac model to do gaze prediction.
